#+TITLE: Conversions from TEI XML --> LaTeX --> PDF

- clone with submodules: ~git clone --recursive~
- update all submodules: ~git submodule foreach git pull~

* Basic ideas

1) Track *.tex files in the file:./TeX/ subdirectory.
2) The LaTeX files are produced by converting the XML files in
   file:./SARIT-corpus/ with the XSLT in
   [[file:Stylesheets/profiles/sarit/latex/to.xsl]]
3) The LaTeX files *have* to be compiled with XeLaTeX from the
   *TeXLive 2015* version, latest version.
4) Keep and use scripts in file:./bin/ (they're supposed to give you
   an idea, we won't develop any fancy programs; e.g.,
   file:./bin/convert_sarit_to_tex.sh).


** Improving the TeX output

Please file an issue if you want to improve something.

To make it easier to track and solve the problem, try and give
information on the following points:

1) Describe the problem, maybe add (a page of) the pdf showing the problem.
2) Where in the tex file does the problem occur?
3) What part of the XML file is the problem coming from?
4) Where in the XSLT stylesheet does the transformation happen?
5) What does the TeX logfile say, if anything?
6) What makes the problem go away?

The more infos you give, the better.

2) Sanskrit 2003
   1) Many ligatures
   2) Good ratio
   3) License unclear
3) Annapurna SIL

   2) Ligatures not so great (ddhya?)
   3) Real bold
4) Sahadeva & Nakula
