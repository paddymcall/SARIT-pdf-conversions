#+TITLE: Conversions from TEI XML --> LaTeX --> PDF

- clone with submodules: ~git clone --recursive~



* Basic ideas

1) Track *.tex files (and compilation logs in *.log) in file:./TeX/ subdirectory.
2) Keep scripts in file:./bin/ (they're supposed to give you an idea).
3) The LaTeX files are produced by converting the XML files in
   file:./SARIT-corpus/ with the XSLT in [[file:Stylesheets/profiles/sarit/latex/to.xsl]]
4) The LaTeX files *have* to be compiled with XeLaTeX from the TeXLive
   2015 version.
